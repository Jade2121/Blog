# Move in August

It was a tough time when you decide to move and finding job in a month, so was to me.

Finding apartments via brokers is unpredictable but interesting. They may introduce you a basement or attic.

Review and revise personal resume is also hard for a new grad without experience. So peer review is important and necessary.
